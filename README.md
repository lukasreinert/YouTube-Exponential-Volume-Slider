# YouTube Exponential Volume Slider
Makes the YouTube video volume slider exponential so it's easier to select lower volumes.

Humans perceive loudness logarithmically, so exponential scaling makes the slider feel more natural and precise at low volumes.


## How to Install a User Script Manager

You’ll need a user script manager such as [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

A helpful guide on how to install one can be found on [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts).
That page also includes **direct links to install the appropriate browser extension** for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and other browsers.

I recommend installing **Tampermonkey**, but any compatible manager will work.


## Installation

### Recommended Method

Visit the script page on Greasy Fork and click **Install**:
